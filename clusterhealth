Letâ€™s start with a basic health check, which we can use to see how our cluster is doing.
To check the cluster health, we will be using the _cat API

GET /_cat/health?v

the output will be 
epoch      timestamp cluster       status node.total node.data shards pri relo init unassign pending_tasks max_task_wait_time active_shards_percent
1551967830 14:10:30  elasticsearch yellow          1         1      9   9    0    0        8             0                  -                 52.9%


Whenever we ask for the cluster health, we either get green, yellow, or red.

Green - everything is good (cluster is fully functional)
Yellow - all data is available but some replicas are not yet allocated (cluster is fully functional)
Red - some data is not available for whatever reason (cluster is partially functional)

Note: When a cluster is red, it will continue to serve search requests from the available shards but you will likely need to fix it ASAP since there are unassigned shards.


To see the nodes health:

GET /_cat/nodes?v

ip        heap.percent ram.percent cpu load_1m load_5m load_15m node.role master name
127.0.0.1           21          81  19                          mdi       *      z8uVnlA
