Installing elastic on windows:
you can go to the download page https://www.elastic.co/downloads and download elastic, kibana and other products
unzip the folder. I have downloaded elasticsearch-6.6.1

navigate to bin folder and click on elasticsearch.bat
after succesfully started, you can enter http://localhost:9200

this will dislay the status of your elastic cluster.

you can change the name of cluster, nodes port and all other details in config\elasticsearch.yml


Install Kibana on Windows:
