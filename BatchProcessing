we can perform batch operations like insert/update/delete using _bulk api


POST /customer/_doc/_bulk?pretty
{"index":{"_id":"1"}}
{"name": "John Doe" }
{"index":{"_id":"2"}}
{"name": "Jane Doe" }

This example updates the first document (ID of 1) and then deletes the second document (ID of 2) in one bulk operation:

POST /customer/_doc/_bulk?pretty
{"update":{"_id":"1"}}
{"doc": { "name": "John Doe becomes Jane Doe" } }
{"delete":{"_id":"2"}}

The Bulk API does not fail due to failures in one of the actions. If a single action fails for whatever reason, it will continue to process the remainder of the actions after it. When the bulk API returns, it will provide a status for each action (in the same order it was sent in) so that you can check if a specific action failed or not.
