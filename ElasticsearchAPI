1. Basic Search:

our data will have like:

{
  "took" : 2,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "bank1",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Jane Doe"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}


GET /bank1/_search?q=name:john
- Where name is the filed in the bank1 index

GET /bank1/_search?q=_id:2
- Where _id is the filed


GET /bank1/_search?q=*


We can also search in multiple indexs

GET /kimchy,elasticsearch/_search?q=name:shamim

if you want to search in all the available indices

GET /_all/_search?q=tag:wow

The parameters allowed in the URI are:

Name	Description
q : The query string (maps to the query_string query, see Query String Query for more details).

df: The default field to use when no field prefix is defined within the query.

analyzer : The analyzer name to be used when analyzing the query string.

analyze_wildcard : Should wildcard and prefix queries be analyzed or not. Defaults to false.

batched_reduce_size: The number of shard results that should be reduced at once on the coordinating node. This value should be used as a protection mechanism to reduce the memory overhead per search request if the potential number of shards in the request can be large.

default_operator: The default operator to be used, can be AND or OR. Defaults to OR.

lenient:If set to true will cause format based failures (like providing text to a numeric field) to be ignored. Defaults to false.

explain:For each hit, contain an explanation of how scoring of the hits was computed.

_source:Set to false to disable retrieval of the _source field. You can also retrieve part of the document by using _source_includes & _source_excludes (see the request body documentation for more details)

stored_fields : The selective stored fields of the document to return for each hit, comma delimited. Not specifying any value will cause no fields to return.

sort:Sorting to perform. Can either be in the form of fieldName, or fieldName:asc/fieldName:desc. The fieldName can either be an actual field within the document, or the special _score name to indicate sorting based on scores. There can be several sort parameters (order is important).

track_scores:When sorting, set to true in order to still track scores and return them as part of each hit.

track_total_hits:Set to false in order to disable the tracking of the total number of hits that match the query. (see Index Sorting for more details). Defaults to true.

timeout: A search timeout, bounding the search request to be executed within the specified time value and bail with the hits accumulated up to that point when expired. Defaults to no timeout.

terminate_after: The maximum number of documents to collect for each shard, upon reaching which the query execution will terminate early. If set, the response will have a boolean field terminated_early to indicate whether the query execution has actually terminated_early. Defaults to no terminate_after.

from:The starting from index of the hits to return. Defaults to 0.

size:The number of hits to return. Defaults to 10.

search_type:The type of the search operation to perform. Can be dfs_query_then_fetch or query_then_fetch. Defaults to query_then_fetch. See Search Type for more details on the different types of search that can be performed.

allow_partial_search_results:Set to false to return an overall failure if the request would produce partial results. Defaults to true, which will allow partial results in the case of timeouts or partial failures. This default can be controlled using the cluster-level setting search.default_allow_partial_results.
